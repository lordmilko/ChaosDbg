# ChaosDbg

ChaosDbg is a x86/x64 Native/Managed/PowerShell debugger/analyzer for Windows.

One of the biggest issues with reverse engineering tools is that they're too specialized.

* IDA Pro is used for analysis
* dnSpy is used for managed debugging, and
* WinDbg is used for native debugging/time travel tracing

ChaosDbg aims to combine the best features of these tools all into a single, user friendly, mixed mode debugger.
